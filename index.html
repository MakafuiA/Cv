        <p>Arguably without computing advancements in areas such as
            engineering and healthcare would be inefficient and almost non-existent.
            Coding is the backbone of computing.
            Without even speaking; at least in the traditional sense,
            codes are used to create systems that anyone in the world can use, this I believe,
            makes computer code the most powerful language in the world, a language I am obsessed with mastering. <br>
            <br>
            As a passionate person who is ready to learn, becoming part of this phenomenon means
            that I would not be left behind in helping to make the world a better place.</p>
